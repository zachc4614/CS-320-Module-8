I can ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure by ensuring that I utilize the best practices when developing my projects.
In order to accomplish this I must pay attention to detail and ensure that I am approaching everything in the most detailed way possible. When
I interpret user needs I usually try to look at it from different perspectives and to take into considerdation the goals and mission of the user.
Sometimes asking questions is all that you need to do in order to accomplish it. When approaching the design of software I always usually create diagrams and/or psuedocode and map out everything I need to do. I try to abide by the Software Development Lifecycle when designing software and ensuring that I look at everything extremely thoroughly when creating and planning it.
